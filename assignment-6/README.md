## ðŸš€ Project Overview

Parcel Xpress is a **secure, role-based, and user-friendly** frontend application for a **Parcel Delivery System** (inspired by Pathao Courier or Sundarban).  

It allows **Senders**, **Receivers**, and **Admins** to seamlessly manage deliveries, track parcels, and monitor the logistics process.  

Built with **React**, **Redux Toolkit**, and **RTK Query**, it ensures smooth state management, real-time API integration, and a responsive design.
